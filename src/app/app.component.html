<p>
  This example shows how to navigate to a child route from anywhere in your app.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  The main component renders the parent component using a router-outlet. The
  main component also renders a third-party component that will do the
  navigation. The child component is rendered inside the parent component.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="container">
  main
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  <app-third-party></app-third-party>
</div>
